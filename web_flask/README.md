AirBnB clone - Web framework

# General :bell_pepper:
This project will cover understanding what a Web Framework is, learning how to build a web framework using Flask, defining routes in Flask, understanding the concept of routes, handling variables within routes, understanding templates, creating an HTML response in Flask using a template, creating dynamic templates with loops and conditions, and displaying data from a MySQL database in HTML.

## Requirements 👍

* We are not allowed to import module.
* Respect the pycodestyle.
* All files must be executable.
* Use #!/usr/bin/python3.

HTML/CSS Files : 
* All files should end with a new line.
* The code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator.
* All CSS files should be in the styles folder.
* All images should be in the images folder.
* Not allowed to use !important or id (#... in the CSS file)

Install Flask : 
`$ pip3 install Flask`

    - Routes :

            - H3 tag: “Cities:”
            - UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
            - LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
        - Otherwise:
            - H1 tag: “Not found!”
    - Use the option `strict_slashes=False` in the route definition.

11. HBNB filters
    - Write a script that starts a Flask web application
    - Application must be listening on `0.0.0.0`, port `5000`
    - Load all cities of a `State`
    - After each request remove the current SQLAlchemy Session.
    - Routes : 
        - `/hbnb_filters`: display a HTML page from  `0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static`
            - Copy files 3-footer.css, 3-header.css, 4-common.css and 6-filters.css from web_static/styles/ to the folder web_flask/static/styles
